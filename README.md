Here are the descriptions for the private GitHub repositories I worked on (p.s. if you are a recruiter and you want to see private code snippets I have worked on, contact me on Twitter or LinkedIn and I will give you view permissions):

# [Zorbi](https://zorbi.cards/)

Zorbi is a flashcard app that predicts when you will forget them. I am the founding engineer of Zorbi. I helped the platform to grow organically from 0 to 20k+ users. Zorbi users create 50K+ unique cards and study 100K+ flashcards every week. The schools that use Zorbi have seen significant academic improvements amongst the students. Below I will list some important technical milestones I have achieved:

- I architected and built the product's payment and referral system using Stripe and RevenueCat for iOS.
- I improved the user query times by 50% and initial load times by 300% through GraphQL query optimization.
- The referral system I designed and built led to thousands of user sign-ups.
- The flashcards import feature uses SQS and Lambda. I helped improve the reliability of the system by fixing some critical bugs. The Lambda API endpoint now has an almost 100% success rate.

# [Shwoop](https://www.shwoop.co.nz/)

Shwoop is turning cities into playgrounds. It's a Pokemon-Go style social networking app. During the initial launch, the app beat LinkedIn and Twitter and was in the top 5 of iOS App Store (NZ) charts in the social networking category. Shwoop closed a $600K deal with the University of Auckland with the goal to help students on the campus to foster meaning friendships between each other. Shwoop has also received a $10K kiwi startup grant from AWS.

I was the CTO of the company from November 2020 to June 2021. I architected and built the app using React Native, React Native Maps, Apollo client for the frontend and AWS ECS, AWS RDS, GraphQL and Nexus for the backend. During my time, I led a team of 3 engineers across the app's development. I architected and scaled the app from zero users to thousands of users. And seeing hundreds of users using the app concurrently in real life was one of the craziest experiences.
