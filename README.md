This repository contains a few code snippets from the private GitHub repositories of which I am a contributor. The code is shown for demonstration purposes only; you won't run most files due to missing dependencies.

Here are the descriptions for the private GitHub repositories I worked on:

# [Shwoop](https://www.shwoop.co.nz/)

Shwoop is turning cities into playgrounds. It's a Pokemon-Go style social networking app. During the initial launch, the app beat LinkedIn and Twitter and was in the top 5 of iOS App Store (NZ) charts in the social networking category.

I was the CTO of the company from November 2020 to June 2021. I architected and built the app using React Native, React Native Maps, Apollo client for the frontend and AWS ECS, AWS RDS, GraphQL and Nexus for the backend. During my time, I led a team of 3 engineers across the app's development. I architected and scaled the app from zero users to thousands of users. And seeing hundreds of users using the app concurrently in real life was one of the craziest experiences.

See more info about the code snippets in the `/shwoop` directory.

# [Zorbi](https://zorbi.cards/)

Zorbi is a flashcard app that predicts when you will forget them. I am the founding engineer of Zorbi. I helped the platform to grow organically from 0 to 20k+ users. Zorbi users create 50K+ unique cards and study 100K+ flashcards every week. The schools that use Zorbi have seen significant academic improvements amongst the students. Below I will list some important technical milestones I have achieved:

- I architected and built the product's payment and referral system using Stripe and RevenueCat for iOS.
- I improved the user query times by 50% and initial load times by 300% through GraphQL query optimization.
- The referral system I designed and built led to thousands of user sign-ups.
- The flashcards import feature uses SQS and Lambda. I helped improve the reliability of the system by fixing some critical bugs. The Lambda API endpoint now has an almost 100% success rate.
